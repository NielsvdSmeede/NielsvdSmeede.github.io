                <p>I am Niels and I study HBO-ICT at the HZ in Middelburg. I think this program fits me, because I
                    really
                    enjoy programming. This is because it gives me a challenge I want to overcome. I'm easily
                    distracted, so if I think something is boring, I'll quit pretty fast. With this program, that's not
                    the case.</p>

                <p>I was introduced to ICT by a friend. He was really into it and showed me how it works a little bit.
                    I was instantly intrigued. Because of him, I started studying HBO-ICT at the HU in Utrecht. Sadly,
                    because of Covid, I didn't have enough CE to pass. I did learn a lot about programming there. After
                    that, I went searching for other schools. I found the HZ, and it seemed like a good school. After
                    comparing some schools, I chose this one. So far I really enjoy it and I hope to learn a lot more
                    the coming four years.</p>
