                    <h3>My study choice</h3>
                    <p>One of my friends was a programmer in his free time. He wanted to make a game for his PWS. I
                        thought this was
                        interesting, so I asked if we could work together. Together with another friend, we made the
                        game. I enjoyed
                        it and started studying ICT in Utrecht. <a href="study_choice.html">Read more.</a></p>

                    <p>In my first year of the study HBO-ICT in Utrecht, I coded a lot with Python. For a group project,
                        we had to
                        make a webshop. In the webshop we had to give recommendations to clients on what more they could
                        buy, based
                        on a dataset we received. Beyond that... <a href="programming_experience.html">Read more</a></p>

                        and Learning, provided internet training and access opportunities for digitally excluded
