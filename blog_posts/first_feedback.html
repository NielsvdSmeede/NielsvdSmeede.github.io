        <h1>My first feedback</h1>
        <br>

        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>By the looks of it, you chose ICT very consciously through personal experience and interest of developing a
            game. Good, that is an intrinsic motivation. But in Utrecht things did not go as planned. Do you know why?
            What do you need in order to be more successful with us and not fall into the same trap, because making the
            game was not enough? What was the reason for Middelburg? The travel from Doorn and back seems to be quite a
            journey, or is it not so bad?</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Future profession</h3>
        <p>Take the next few weeks to do some research on a possible job in IT that appeals to you. If you have that as
            an example, you will have more motivation to stick with a study. I look forward to seeing what you can show
            in your website about this in due time.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>SWOT</h3>
        <p>How can you start making sure that you are more on top of what your schedule is? From what I read, that is
            the biggest danger; starting too late and other priorities. How do you organize and combine for yourself if
            and what you will deploy?<br>
            You also indicate you are easily distracted. What can you use to increase your focus? What makes you easily
            distracted?<br>
            Could not being able to find a room be a threat to your study progress?</p>
