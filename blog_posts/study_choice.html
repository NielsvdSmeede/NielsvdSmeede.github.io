        <h1>My study choice</h1>
        <br>

        <h3>Motivate your study choice</h3>
        <p>One of my friends was a programmer in his free time. He wanted to make a game for his PWS. I thought this was
            interesting, so I asked if we could work together. Together with another friend, we made the game. I enjoyed
            it and started studying ICT in Utrecht. Sadly, I failed the program because I didn't invest enough time in
            it. After that, I went looking for other schools where I could study ICT. I found schools in Zwolle,
            Tilburg and Middelburg, amongst others. The HZ in Middelburg was the school that seemed the most fun and
            suited me the best.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Study choice activities</h3>
        <p>I didn't do a lot of study choice activities. The last two years I did another ICT study en thought it was
            a lot of fun. I looked at the website of the different school that offer the ICT program and the HZ seemed
            the most fun.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>After completing the study...</h3>
        <p>After the study I want to work, but I don't know where yet. I'm hoping to get to know the different sides of
            ICT during an internship, or at least at the end of the study.<br>
            I want to learn how to program complicated
            algorithms and how machine learning works. I also want to learn how to use different programs, like Unity,
            and different programming languages.</p>
