        <h1>My study choice</h1>
        <br>

        <h3>Motivate your study choice</h3>
        <p>One of my friends was a programmer in his free time. He wanted to make a game for his PWS. I thought this was
            interesting, so I asked if we could work together. Together with another friend, we made the game. I enjoyed
            it and started studying ICT in Utrecht. Sadly, I failed the program because I didn't invest enough time in
            it. After that, I went looking for other schools where I could study ICT. I found schools in Zwolle,
            Tilburg and Middelburg, amongst others. The HZ in Middelburg was the school that seemed the most fun and
            suited me the best. At the moment I have a studio in Vlissingen.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Study choice activities</h3>
        <p>I didn't do a lot of study choice activities. The last two years I did another ICT study en thought it was
            a lot of fun. I looked at the website of the different school that offer the ICT program and the HZ seemed
            the most fun.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>After completing the study...</h3>
        <p>I think I am going to choose software engineer as study track. I am not going to do another study after this
            one, so I will probably search for work as a software engineer.<br>
            After this study I want to learn how to program complicated algorithms and how machine learning works. I
            also want to learn how to use different programs, like Unity, and different programming languages. That is
            if I don't learn it during my time at the HZ.</p>
